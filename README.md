# dependency_job

* Imagine we have a list of jobs, each represented by a character. Because certain jobs must be done before others, a job may have a dependency on another job. For example, a may depend on b, meaning the final sequence of jobs should place b before a. If a has no dependency, the position of a in the final sequence does not matter.
* Given youâ€™re passed an empty string (no jobs), the result should be an empty sequence.
* Given the following job structure:
```
a =>
```
The result should be a sequence consisting of a single job a.
Given the following job structure:
```
a =>  b =>  c =>
```
The result should be a sequence containing all three jobs abc in no significant order.
